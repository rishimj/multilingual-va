# Dynamics Language Detection Voice Assistant

### Summary
This voice assistant utilizes a custom built language detecton model that can differentiate between spoken English, Hindi, and Telugu speech. This particular use case entails that the user no longer has to "specify" a language in settings or speak in a certain language. Rather, the user can dynamically change the language being spoken to the voice assistant at any time and the voice assistant will take input in and reply in that language. For example, the user may at first ask a question in English, get a response in English, and immediately ask another question in Hindi, and get a response in Hindi - thus removing the language barrier.
